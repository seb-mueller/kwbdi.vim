*kwbdi.txt* Delete a buffer while keeping the window open

==============================================================================
Introduction                                                      *kwbdi*

In order to unload and delete a buffer from the buffer list :bd is your friend 
(:h bd). 
An oftern unpleasent side effect is that this also closes the window changing
the window layout. 

Kwbdi allows you to delete a buffer without closing the window. 
It meets the following criteria:

    * The window layout must be kept in all circumstances.
    * If there is an alternate buffer must be showing that.
    * If there is not alternate buffer then must be showing the previous buffer.
    * If there is no alternate nor previous buffer (it is the only buffer) 
      must show an empty buffer. 

If there are two windows with the same buffer open, 
both windows will remain open, and the buffer will be deleted

Usage                                                            *kwbdi-usage*

<leader>bd    Delete current buffer while keeping the window open.
              Throws error and doesn't delete buffer if buffer is modified 
              (safe option)

<leader>bD    Same as above but changes in current buffer are discarded 
              without asking (be careful!).
